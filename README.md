**Description**: The Iris dataset, also known as Fisher's Iris or Anderson's Iris, is a multivariate dataset introduced in 1936 by Ronald Fisher in his paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of the application of linear discriminant analysis. Data were collected by Edgar Anderson to quantify variations in the morphology of iris flowers of three species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula. "All are from the same field, picked on the same day and measured on the same day by the same person with the same measuring tools".
